# Test Driven Development

TODO Replace this file with updates

I am using this project to learn and practice Test Driven Development methods. I am aiming to use a quaterly cycle where I plan features, a weekly cycle where I write integration tests and a daily cycle where I use TDD to generate unit tests and the code for the project. This page describes the setup for each of the tests.

## Testing


### Frontend Unit Tests

I have added [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html) to the quasar project. Unit tests can be run by changing to the /webfrontend directory and running "npm test".
Tests are in the /webfrontend/test folder and follow the naming convention *.test.js


## Build Process

TODO I will document my full build process which generates the docker image here
